# DashboardNetwork
 a place where people can come together and work on one dashboard as well as blog about whatever they want

I have limited experience with making a website from scratch however I am still going to make this projet. Whenever you see a file called "testing" or has the word "Test" in it, then thoes are the files where I experiement with whatever updates I want to make to the website. However, untill I fix the bugs, I do not add them to the whole project.
